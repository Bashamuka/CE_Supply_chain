  # Apply OTC Logic Integration Migration
  
  ## Purpose
  Apply the migration that adds OTC logic to Project Management module.
  This script executes the migration and provides verification steps.
  
  ## Steps
  1. Apply the migration
  2. Verify the changes
  3. Test both calculation methods
  4. Provide usage instructions
