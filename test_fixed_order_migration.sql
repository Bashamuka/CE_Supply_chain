/*
  # Test Fixed OTC Logic Migration - Order Issue Resolved
  
  ## Purpose
  Test the corrected migration that fixes the order of view creation.
  This script verifies that all views are created in the correct dependency order.
  
  ## Test Steps
  1. Apply the corrected migration
  2. Verify all views exist in correct order
  3. Test functionality
  4. Confirm no dependency errors
