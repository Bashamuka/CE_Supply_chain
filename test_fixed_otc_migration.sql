/*
  # Test Fixed OTC Logic Migration
  
  ## Purpose
  Test the corrected migration that handles the CASCADE dependency issue.
  This script verifies that the migration applies successfully without errors.
  
  ## Test Steps
  1. Apply the corrected migration
  2. Verify all objects are created
  3. Test the diagnostic view
  4. Confirm functionality
