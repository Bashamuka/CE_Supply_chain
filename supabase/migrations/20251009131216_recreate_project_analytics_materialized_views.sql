  # Recreate Project Analytics Materialized Views

  ## Purpose
  This migration recreates all materialized views for project analytics optimization.
  These views dramatically improve performance by pre-computing aggregations at the database level.

  ## Views Created

  1. **mv_project_machine_parts_aggregated**
     - Aggregates machine parts with deduplicated part numbers
     - Sums quantity_required for duplicate parts within same machine

  2. **mv_project_parts_stock_availability**
     - Pre-calculates available stock quantities per part across all branches
     - Uses stock_dispo table (not stock_availability)

  3. **mv_project_parts_used_quantities**
     - Pre-calculates quantities used per part per machine from orders

  4. **mv_project_parts_transit_invoiced**
     - Pre-calculates transit and invoiced quantities per part per project
     - Filters out completed and cancelled deliveries

  5. **mv_project_analytics_complete**
     - Final aggregated view with progressive allocation logic
     - Machines are allocated resources in creation order
     - Includes ETA tracking

  ## Performance Impact
  - Reduces 1000+ queries to 1-2 queries per analytics request
  - Expected speedup: 50-100x faster

  ## Refresh Strategy
  - Call refresh_project_analytics_views() function to update all views
  - Or refresh individually: REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY view_name
