  # Create materialized views for project analytics optimization

  ## Purpose
  This migration creates materialized views to dramatically improve the performance
  of project analytics calculations by pre-computing aggregations at the database level.

  ## Views Created

  1. **mv_project_machine_parts_aggregated**
     - Aggregates machine parts with deduplicated part numbers
     - Sums quantity_required for duplicate parts within same machine
     - Purpose: Eliminates application-level deduplication logic

  2. **mv_project_parts_stock_availability**
     - Pre-calculates available stock quantities per part across all branches
     - Joins with project branches to compute totals
     - Purpose: Replaces multiple individual stock queries

  3. **mv_project_parts_used_quantities**
     - Pre-calculates quantities used per part per machine from orders
     - Aggregates across all order numbers linked to machines
     - Purpose: Eliminates per-part order queries

  4. **mv_project_parts_transit_invoiced**
     - Pre-calculates transit and invoiced quantities per part per project
     - Filters out "Delivery completed" and cancelled/received items
     - Separates transit (not yet invoiced) from invoiced quantities
     - Purpose: Replaces complex filtering and aggregation in application

  5. **mv_project_analytics_complete**
     - Final aggregated view combining all above views
     - Calculates all percentages and missing quantities
     - Ready-to-use data for frontend display
     - Purpose: Single query retrieves all analytics data

  ## Performance Impact
  - Reduces 1000+ queries to 1-2 queries per analytics request
  - Expected speedup: 50-100x faster
  - Trade-off: Needs periodic refresh (can be automated)

  ## Refresh Strategy
  Views need to be refreshed when underlying data changes:
  - Can be done on-demand via: REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY view_name;
  - Or automated via pg_cron extension
  - CONCURRENTLY option allows queries during refresh

  ## Security
  - RLS policies will be applied when querying through Supabase client
  - Views respect the permissions of the querying user
